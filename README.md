# IT-conference-manager
Sii Recruitment task

# Overwiev
This application is the backend for an IT conference management website. It allows, for example, to view the agenda of the entire conference, view reservations of a specific person, or add and delete reservations. Users of this application can also update their email. The application allows you to display how many percent of seats at lectures are occupied and which topic of lectures is most often chosen by participants.

# How to run
To make running the application easier, I have prepared the `run.bat` file. Just click on it to start the application.
